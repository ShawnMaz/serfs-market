# The Serf's Market

## Table of Contents

## Description
The Serf’s Market is a full-stack game application that helps you increase your financial literacy in a fun and unique way. The game is a fictionalized & centralized online “stock” market that changes every hour, where users can create their own Peasantly Portfolio and compete against others to be the most bountiful member of the kingdom’s sub-working class. Buy stock in arrows, watch their value crash (or skyrocket in the Indo-Briton clash of 1503), and come back later to cash out big!
