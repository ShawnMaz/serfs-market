                <p>
                    Have you ever wanted to invest in the stock market but been scared away by such pesky concepts as “permanent financial embarrassment” and “unpredictable asset depreciation leading to irreversible domestic ruination”? Fear no more, as the Serf’s Market has come to fill the gap in your heart that Wall Street has left!

                    The Serf’s Market is a fictionalized & centralized online “stock” market that changes every hour, where users can create their own Peasantly Portfolio and compete against others to be the most bountiful member of the kingdom’s sub-working class. Buy stock in arrows, watch their value crash (or skyrocket in the Indo-Briton clash of 1503), and come back later to cash out big!
